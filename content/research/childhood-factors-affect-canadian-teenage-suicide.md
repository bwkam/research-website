# Motivation
Suicide is a tragic public health concern, and in Canada, it is the second leading cause of death among
young adults. This concerning trend demands a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to
youth suicide. This research explores potential risk factors during childhood and adolescence.

# Hypothesis
Excessive childhood screen time and low religious involvement are associated with a high
suicide risk. Social rejection is an important factor, but it alone isn't capable of triggering suicide,
and overcoming the effects of any other variables.

# Thesis
By examining the possible factors behind the high rate of suicide among Canadian youth–
excessive screen time during childhood, low religious involvement, and social exclusion–this
paper will argue that heavy technology use and screentime reveals patterns of potential suicide
risk among children aged nine to twelve years old. Religious involvement provides protection
against suicidal attempts and ideation even after experiencing trauma, but protection against
suicidal attempts specifically varies depending on factors such as cultural details. While social
exclusion appears to be linked to suicidal ideation through depression, it's unlikely to be the sole
trigger.

# Findings
## Childhood and Suicide
Statistics Canada has some concerning news which indicate that suicide is the second leading
cause of death among Canadian youth, highlighting the importance of understanding and
researching the influence of childhood factors on the risk of suicide in teenage years
(Government of Canada). The psychosexual theory of development by Sigmund Freud and the
psychosocial theory of development by Erik Erikson offer some important insights here;
Erikson's model specifically emphasizes the importance of the adolescent stage in forming a
strong sense of identity, and how particular habits and events may influence suicidal risk. If a kid
goes through some tough stuff during that period, it can leave them more vulnerable later on.
And we all know how serious the issue of youth suicide is in Canada. Challenges during this
crucial period of identity formation could be linked to the high suicide rates seen in Canadian
teenagers ("Psychosexual and Psychosocial Theories of Development").

## Screen Time and Technology Use
There is a clear link between screen time, suicidal behavior, and kids aged 9-11 (Berthold).
Considering Canada's youthful population, and the fact that many children are glued to their
devices, this could be a big factor in those high suicide rates. Turns out, the more time they spend
texting, video chatting, gaming, etc., the higher their suicide risk goes up by 9% per additional
Time. However, excessive screen time displaces important activities and increases exposure to
negative content, making them more prone to suicidal thoughts down the line (Berthold).[^1] Many kids
these days have accounts on popular social media such as TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, etc. And
this is just wrong given the massive amount of toxicity on it and risks they may come across, especially
when they are still not fully mature, which makes an easy victim for suicidal ideation.

[^1]: More research is needed to understand the cause-effect relationship between heavy technology use
and suicidal ideation.

## Religious Involvement
This one is very interesting, let's see together. Religious faith and attendance seem to provide a buffer against
suicidal thoughts and attempts in youth, and religious affiliation and belief in God are associated
with lower risk of suicide. Even after going through trauma, that spiritual connection can make a
real difference, and this role can't be downplayed (Rosmarin).[^2] One study on a series of
Canadian high schools found the more religious involvement, the less suicidal ideation. But this
behavior is not consistent among other cultures.[^3] Whether religious affiliation protects against
suicide attempts may depend on the culture-specific implications of affiliating with a particular
religion, since minority religious groups can feel socially isolated (Lawrence et al.). It's definitely a
complex issue to say the least, and future studies need to be conducted.

[^2]: Rosmarin shares the story of an individual, John, who despite his severe childhood trauma, did not
commit suicide because "he believes in God".
[^3]: A particular study discovered an opposite trend among Chinese; suicides were more likely to have a
religious affiliation.

## Social Rejection and Exclusion
There is a strong link between social exclusion and suicidal ideation in adolescents, and
depression is a big part of that equation. Interestingly, one of the findings is that having a strong
sense of purpose and meaning in life can actually weaken the association between depression and
suicidal thoughts.

So even if they're feeling isolated, having that internal drive and sense of
meaning can be protective (Zhu et al.). Which logically implies that, the role of social exclusion
is not permanent in the presence of other variables, such as the "meaning of life". Expanding on
the role of depression, a high number of young Canadians have been experiencing depression,
and according to CBC News, the depression is linked to suicide, which in many cases can be
"invisible" ("11% of Canadians Aged 15-24 Met Criteria for Depression: StatsCan").[^4] This is a
really crucial factor to consider when it comes to the high rate of suicide among Canadian youth.

[^4]: According to the article, “11% of Canadians Aged 15-24 Met Criteria for Depression: StatsCan”, a 14
years old girl who committed suicide, Madeline, kept her decision of suicide off the radar.

# Summary of Findings
Several childhood factors may be associated with an increased risk of suicide during teenage
years. Social rejection and exclusion appear to be linked to suicidal ideation, potentially
mediated by depression. Religious involvement may be protective, although some studies present
conflicting views on the role of religious activity. Screen time has also been linked to an
increased suicide risk on children aged nine to twelve years old. Finally, it is important to note
that social rejection is unlikely to be the sole factor leading to suicide, and a strong sense of
purpose in life can mitigate its negative effects.
